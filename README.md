Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) to practice using various C ++ data structures and algorithms. The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) defines a common format for public transportation schedules/routes. This allows us to use real world data to practice different aspects of dealing with large data structures.

## Built With

* [GTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification) - The data framework used
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) - Developpement language
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - Dev environnement
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Used to build, test and package the software
